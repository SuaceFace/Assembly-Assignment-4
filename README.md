# Assembly-Assignment-4
My second x86 assembly program written for class, this time focusing on loops. Uses the Irvine Library.
Instructions: 
Write a complete program that:
    1. Prompt the user to enter 10 numbers.
    2. save those numbers in a 32-bit integer array.
    3. Print the array with the same order it was entered.
    3. Calculate the sum of the numbers and display it.
    4. Calculate the mean of the array and display it.
    5. Rotate the members in the array forward one position for
       9 times. so the last rotation will display the array in reversed order.
    6. Print the array after each rotation.
       check the sample run.
  
      
      ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
      Don't use any shift or rotate instructions which we have not covered
yet. You need to use loops and any kind of addressing.
      All you work should be on the original array. Don't make
      a copy of the array at any time.
      Add comments to make your program easy to read.
      check the rubric before you submit.

 

Sample Run:

Please enter a number: 2
Please enter a number: 3
Please enter a number: 4
Please enter a number: 5
Please enter a number: 6
Please enter a number: 7
Please enter a number: 8
Please enter a number: 9
Please enter a number: 0
Please enter a number: 10
The sum is: 54
The mean is: 5 4/10
The original array: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10
After a rotation: 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
After a rotation: 10 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
After a rotation: 10 0 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 2 3 4 5 6 7
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 7 2 3 4 5 6
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 7 6 2 3 4 5
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 2 3 4
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 2 3
After a rotation: 10 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
